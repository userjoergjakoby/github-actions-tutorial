# Running tests inside GitHub actions
Goal of this chapter is to run the angular tests when a pull request is created or updated.
For this you are going to create a new workflow.

## Steps of the workflow
For running angular tests inside the workflow, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run a container
2. Checkout the code
3. Install Node.js
4. Install dependencies
5. Run the tests

## Create the workflow
Create a file named `test-on-pullrequest.yml`.

## Run a container
Add the following code to your `test-on-pullrequest.yml`.
It will run the workflow on (re-)opening and synchronizing a pull request.
It will then create a job called `Run Angular tests` running inside an ubuntu container.
```yml
name: Run Angular tests

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  docs:
    name: 'Run Angular tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

## Checkout the code
To checkout the repository you use the action `actions/checkout@v3` ([Find the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/actions/checkout)).
It uses a parameter `with` to define which commit should be checked out.
`${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` gets the head of the current pull request.
```yml
    steps:
      - name: '☁️ Checkout repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
```

## Install Node.js
By using `actions/setup-node@v3` ([Find the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/actions/setup-node)),
you can easily set up Node.js, so you will be able to run Angular tests.
```yml
      - name: '⚙️ Use Node.js'
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          check-latest: true
          cache: 'npm'
```

## Install dependencies
It is also possible to run custom code for example `npm install`.
By adding the following you will be able to install dependencies.
```yml
      - name: '⛓️ Install dependencies'
        run: npm ci --no-optional --no-audit --prefer-offline --progress=false
```

## Run the tests
To run the tests you need to call `npm test`. You will also do this by defining a new step with the `run` property.
```yml
      - name: 'Test'
        run: npm test
```

## Trigger the workflow
To trigger the workflow you now need to create a new pull request.
To do so, create a new branch, do some changes and push it. Now create a pull request.
This should start a new build which you can find in the tab `Actions`.

## Branch protection / PR rules
Without any further settings it will be possible to merge the pull request with or without a successful workflow run.
To make the successful run a condition to being able to merge a pull request you need to set up branch protection.  
Go to your repository &rarr; Settings &rarr; Branches &rarr; Branch protection rules &rarr; Add rule  

![](assets/branch-protection.png)  

You can protect all your branches by simply adding `*` as branch name pattern.
By checking the option `Require status checks to pass before merging`, it will no longer be possible to merge pull requests
without a successful workflow run.

## The workflow
```yml
name: Run Angular tests

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  docs:
    name: 'Run Angular tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: '☁️ Checkout repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

      - name: '⚙️ Use Node.js'
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          check-latest: true
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: '⛓️ Install dependencies'
        run: npm ci --no-optional --no-audit --prefer-offline --progress=false

      - name: 'Test'
        run: npm test
```
